# 📖 Echoes Between the Lines

> *A living, AI-powered interactive book that evolves uniquely for every reader.*

## 📜 Description

**Echoes Between the Lines** is a fictional open-source project exploring the future of interactive storytelling. Instead of following a predetermined path, each story is generated on the fly with the help of AI — making every journey personal, unpredictable, and unforgettable.

This is not just a "choose your own adventure" — this is a **story that listens**, **remembers**, and **grows** with the reader.
